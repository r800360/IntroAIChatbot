god|The short answer to this question is, yes, the Holy Spirit as described in the Bible is fully God. Along with God the Father and God the Son (Jesus Christ), God the Spirit is the third member of the Godhead or the Trinity.
leave|The fact that the Holy Spirit will never leave a believer is seen in (Ephesians 1:13-14) where believers are said to be "sealed" with the Holy Spirit, "who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession-to the praise of his glory."
seal|The Holy Spirit is the Christian's seal. He seals his people. God's own Spirit comes to indwell or take up residence in the believer. The promised Holy Spirit identifies God's people as his inheritance. And the experience of the Holy Spirit in a believer's life is proof to them, and a demonstration to others, of the genuineness of their faith. The Holy Spirit provides the inward assurance that they belong to God as children (cf. Rom. 8:15-16; Gal. 4:6).

The Holy Spirit assists believers in prayer (Jude 1:20) and "intercedes for God's people in accordance with the will of God" (Romans 8:26-27).

intercede|God gets in touch with our suffering, but does so in a way that maintains his freedom and holiness. Intercession implies, first, a distance between suffering believers and God that must be overcome and, second, a mediating party who bridges the gap. (Romans 8:26-27).
